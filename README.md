# IntelliKeys: A Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV and Mediapipe👋⌨️

This project allows users to interact with a virtual keyboard using hand gestures captured through a webcam. The system detects hand movements and translates them into keyboard inputs, enabling users to type text without physical keys.

## Features ✨

- Hand tracking using MediaPipe 🤚
- Virtual keyboard with customizable keys 🔤
- Real-time display of hand gestures 👀
- Support for basic keyboard functionalities (typing, backspace, space, etc.) ⌨️

## Usage 💻

1. Run the `main.py` file
2. Position your hand in front of the webcam.
3. Use gestures to interact with the virtual keyboard:
- Move your index finger to navigate keys.
- Bring your thumb close to your index finger to select a key.
- Use gestures to type, delete, or space as required.
